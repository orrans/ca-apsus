        <p>This project is a collaborative effort between Ran and Or-Ran, aimed at recreating and enhancing the core functionality of Google's Gmail and Keep applications. Our goal is to build a comprehensive web application that demonstrates advanced front-end development skills while providing users with an intuitive and powerful productivity platform.</p>
        <p>The Mail application replicates Gmail's essential features, including inbox management, email composition, folder organization, and email viewing. Meanwhile, the Note application mirrors Google Keep's functionality, allowing users to create, edit, organize, and manage notes with ease.</p>
        <p>Through this project, we've explored modern web development practices, component-based architecture, and user experience design. We've strived to create an application that not only functions well but also provides a smooth and enjoyable user experience that matches the quality of the applications that inspired it.</p>
